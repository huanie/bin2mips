* Usage
#+begin_src shell
  cargo run "0000 0000 1001 0000 0001 0000 0010 0111"
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src shell
  cargo run 0000 0000 1001 0000 0001 0000 0010 0111
#+end_src

Just type the sequence, they don't need to be separated with spaces but it's nicer to read.

* CSV files
If the op_code, func_code or register numbers change you can change it in the files. You only need to fill the *BINARY*, *REGISTER*, *BINARY* and *COMMAND* columns. The other ones exist because I used a spreadsheet program to write them.

* Use at your own risk
